# Machine-learning-implement
There are some implementations of machine learning in this repository, including KNN classification,K-means clustering and different kinds of deep neural networks using both of Keras and Tensorflow. Comments is included to explain the function of each section.

In K-means and KNN, we use the iris dataset for the implementation.

In the Keras_VGG16.ipynb and Tensorflow_VGG16.ipynb, we firstly adjust the ratio of images to 1:1 by using the zero padding in the "img_padding" function and then resize into 224:224 to feed our Self-built VGG16 model. You can put your own data in different folders for each class to train the discriminative model.
