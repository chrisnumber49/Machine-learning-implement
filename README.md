# Machine-learning-implement
There are some implementations of machine learning in this repository, including KNN classification,K-means clustering and different kinds of deep neural networks using both of Keras and Tensorflow. Comments is included to explain the function of each section.

In K-means and KNN, we use the iris dataset to implement the code.

In the Keras_VGG16.ipynb and Tensorflow_VGG16.ipynb, we firstly adjust the ratio of the picture to 1:1 with using the zero padding in the "img_padding" function and then resize the image into 224:224 to feed our Self-built VGG16 model. you can put your own data in different folders for each class to train the discriminative model.
